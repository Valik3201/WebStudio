## 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

The Web Studio project is a website development task aimed at creating a fictional web design agency's online presence. It includes various sections like Studio, Portfolio, and a Contact Form.

### Project Objectives

- Develop a responsive website layout.
- Implement HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for functionality.
- Create a visually appealing design using modern web development techniques.
- Ensure the project follows best coding practices and standards.

---

## 2. Project Structure <a name="project-structure"></a>

### Directory Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website's homepage.
- `portfolio.html`: HTML file for the Portfolio page.
- `css/`: Contains the main stylesheet `styles.css`.
- `images/`: Houses all project images and icons.
- `js/`: Includes JavaScript files for interactivity (`modal.js` and `mobile-menu.js`).

### Coding Standards

The project adheres to the following coding standards:

- All code is properly indented and formatted using Prettier.
- File and folder names use lowercase letters, with no spaces or special characters.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are separate and organized within their respective directories.
- Use of external libraries and frameworks is minimized, focusing on native web technologies.

---

## 3. HTML Structure <a name="html-structure"></a>

### Semantic HTML

- The HTML structure follows semantic markup practices, ensuring that the document outline is clear.
- Proper HTML5 structural elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` are used.

### Modular Structure

- Content is organized into separate HTML files for each page, enhancing maintainability.
- Common elements like the header and footer are included using HTML `include` or copied and pasted to ensure consistency across pages.

### Accessibility

- All images have appropriate `alt` attributes to ensure accessibility.
- Forms have `<label>` elements associated with form inputs for accessibility and usability.

---

## 4. CSS Styling <a name="css-styling"></a>

### Global Styles

- Global CSS styles are defined in the `styles.css` file.
- CSS properties are organized and grouped logically.

### Responsive Design

- Styles are implemented with a Mobile First approach.
- Media queries are used to adjust styling for different screen sizes.
- All content is responsive and adapts to various device resolutions and orientations.

### Naming Conventions

- Class and ID names follow clear, meaningful, and lowercase conventions.

---

## 5. JavaScript Interactivity <a name="javascript-interactivity"></a>

### JavaScript Files

- JavaScript functionality is separated into distinct files (`modal.js` and `mobile-menu.js`) to maintain a modular structure.

### Interactivity

- JavaScript is used to enhance user interactivity, such as modal pop-ups and mobile menu functionality.
- Event listeners and handlers are implemented to manage user interactions.

---

## 6. Responsive Design <a name="responsive-design"></a>

### Media Queries

- Media queries are employed to create a responsive layout.
- The website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Mobile Menu

- A mobile menu is implemented to provide an optimal user experience on smaller screens.
- The menu is styled and functional, offering smooth navigation on mobile devices.
